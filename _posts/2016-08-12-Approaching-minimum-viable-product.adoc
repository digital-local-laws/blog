= Approaching minimum viable product

Some recent changes make one of the steps needed to get a minimum viable product ready for clerks to try out.
We are now storing the information for each node or structured unit of the law in a single file instead of multiple files.
The next step is to develop a driver that allows the legal code to reside in a gitlab repo instead of local file storage.
Once that is implemented, we should be able to deploy to gitlab and make a demo instance available for trying out.
Anyone want to help with remaining steps?
