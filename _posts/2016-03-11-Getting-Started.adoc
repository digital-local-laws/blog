= Getting Started

At the suggestion of some of the wonderful people who have stepped forward to contribute advice to this project, I am starting this blog about our project's progress.  This blog serves two roles.  One is to inform.  The other is as an experiment.  I am posting it using HubPress, a tool which uses GitHub the same way I ultimately hope this prototype will.
